This is a repository containing Kerbal Operating System files which will allow the user to fly Starship from Launch - Landing automatically.
*The code is licensed under GNUGPL3, please respect this and credit me and the respective contributers! (or just this github)*

You can change some of the variables within the program, these can be found in the Init function, however everything may need tweaking to suit your current setup.

## Current & Upcoming Features

Currently, the starship software is fairly "hard coded" and uses some fairly dangerous methods of controlling the descent, however it somehow still manages to land.

__Current Build__
- Ascent to 10 Kilometers 
- Gradual Engine Cutoffs
- Guided landings with engine redundancy

__Upcoming__
- Ascent to any altitude
- Offsets for staying straight on unbalanced engine config
- Better landing engine transitions, better for rocket
